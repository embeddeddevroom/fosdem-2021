# Project details
## Title of devroom

Embedded, Mobile and Automotive

## Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)

For many years the Embedded, Mobile and Automotive devroom was one of
the most popular devrooms at FOSDEM. After an unfortune break in 2019,
we are working hard to bring EMA devroom to its finest.

The goal of this devroom is to showcase open source from embedded,
mobile and automotive areas.

Possible topics include:
* Hardware hacking
* FOSS in embedded programming
* The Linux Kernel
* FOSS in mobile area
* FOSS in automotive area

## Why does it fit FOSDEM?

The Embedded, Mobile and Automotive industries heavily depend on
FOSS. There are so many related open source projects that it is almost
impossible to know them all. That's why we believe that knowledge
sharing is a main goal of this devroom.

The devroom used to be a great way of connecting open source
contributors from all related projects. Resurrecting the devroom will
attract low level programmers to visit the conference and allow us to
stimulate embedded community integration.
